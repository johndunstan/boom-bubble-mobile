# Boom Bubble 💥🧼

Boom Bubble is a mobile app that lists a series of X items and allows a user to mark them as complete.

## Back Story & Motivation

The general idea is to have a simple app to track how many times something was completed. The idea came from wanting a simple way to track things in my life. My original prototype was a piece of paper with circles drawn on it representing each Saturday workshop of NuCamp. After class on Saturdays my son marks off a circle so we know how many more Saturday mornings we have to go. (See wireframes for a picture of it.)

Boom Bubble is based on the web version of [Moment Counter](https://github.com/johndunstan/moment-counter).

My son, who is 7, says I should call it Boom Bubble rather than Moment Counter (he thinks it’s a game). He’s probably right!
